# Customer-Analysis-using-Kmeans-Clustering
Customer Segmentation is performed based on the Income and the Spending Score. The best possible cluster is found using KMeans Clustering .
From the result, we obtained the following result:
1.In each cluster, proportion of female population is greater than male. So female are the ones who would like to spend more.
2.Also, found the group with mean income of 86K would are likely high to spend more.
3.A group with low income also exists with higher spending score. This could be probably if there was any sales events or the customer were buying any high price merchandise that depends on the business.
